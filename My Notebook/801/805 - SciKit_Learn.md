""" Machine Learning """

## Supervised Learning (SL)

The software is trained under a predefined dataset. Thus the algorithm can makes decisions when receive new data.
There is two kind of SL

    1. Classification: The code creates labels to divide the data in categories
    2. Regression


## Unsupervised Learning

The software find an automatic way patterns between datasets.
