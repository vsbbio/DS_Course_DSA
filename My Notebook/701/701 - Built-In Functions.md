## map function:

" It allows apply a function to all elements and return a sequence changed."

### Structure: map(function, object).


## [] function:

" It allows apply an arbitrary function to all elements 
and the sequence is changed."

### Structure: 
 1. obj = [ x for x in "python"].
 2. obj = [ x**2 for x in range(100)]
 3. obj = [ x for x in range(100) if x%2==0 ]

## reduce function, imported from functools module:

" It allows apply a function to all elements and following 
the called function, it reduce all elements to one"

### Structure: reduce(function, object)


## filter function:

" It allows apply a function to all elements and return 
just if true."

### Structure: map(function, object).


## zip function:

"It allows combine different sequences and return a new sequence. 
That new sequence will have a total elements equal of the smaller sequence."

### Structure: zip(object1, object2).


## enumerate function:

"It return an index of the given sequence."

### Structure: enumerate(object).
